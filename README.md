# sqlalchemy-challenge

Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii! To help with your trip planning, you need to do some climate analysis on the area. The following outlines what you need to do.
To begin, use Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. All of the following analysis should be completed using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
Precipitation Analysis


Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data.
Station Analysis


Design a query to calculate the total number of stations.


Design a query to find the most active stations.
Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of temperature observation data (TOBS).
